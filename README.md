# Linear Regression and Correlation

**Introduction**

The North Carolina State Center for Health Statistics and Howard W. Odum Institute for Research in Social Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill make publicly available birth and infant death data for all children born in the state of North Carolina. The dataset, spanning from 1968 to the present, encompasses a wide record of data collection. Within the extensive dataset that comprises of 120,300 entries from 2001, we will focus on a random sample of 800 births, from which a subset of 80 records has been selected for this case study.

**Objectives**

The objectives of this unit are to understand how to formulate a single predictor linear regression model and to visualize that potential linear relationship. Additionally, this report will be able to compute and interpret the Grubbs to identify any potential outliers, remove those outliers, if necessary, compute coefficient of correlation and regression analysis.
